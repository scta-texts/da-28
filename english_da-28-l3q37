          Then there is a question on the chapter about phantasy: Is
          phantasy the same as sense?
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-02">
          <supplied><hi rendition="simple:bold">1<hi
          rendition="simple:superscript">st</hi> arg.</hi></supplied> First
          argument for the affirmative answer: Every organic cognitive power
          appears to be sense; for sense differs from intellect in this regard
          <supplied>= in being an organic cognitive power</supplied>, as it is
          evident from psychology; but phantasy is an organic cognitive power,
          as it is manifest from <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>,
          <title>De anima</title>, book II and III.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-03">
          <supplied><hi rendition="simple:bold">2<hi
          rendition="simple:superscript">nd</hi> arg.</hi></supplied> Likewise,
          if <supplied>cognitive</supplied> powers have the same object, they
          are identical. This sentence appears to be manifest. For powers differ
          from each other with regard to their acts, and acts <supplied>differ
          from each other</supplied> with regard to their objects, as it is
          commonly said. But phantasy has the same object as sense. For, as much
          as sight can see a color, phantasy can phantasize it; and the same is
          to be said about the other
          <cb ed="#Ve_1544" n="b"/>
          senses. Therefore etc. <supplied>= the conclusion is reached</supplied>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-04">
          <supplied><hi rendition="simple:bold">3<hi
          rendition="simple:superscript">rd</hi> arg.</hi></supplied> Likewise,
          phantasy is either a sense or a motion brought about by a sense
          according to its being in act. This disjunction appears to be
          exhaustive according to <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, since
          phantasy cannot be science, nor opinion, nor intellect, nor something
          composed by opinion and science, as <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> shows in his text
          <supplied><title>De anima</title> III 3</supplied>. Without any doubt,
          therefore, it remains that phantasy is either a sense or a motion
          brought about by a sense according to its being in act. But it cannot
          be a motion brought about by a sense according to its being in act.
          The reason is that no motion remains when a mover is lacking. This
          sentence is manifest by itself and is found in <title>Physics</title>,
          III; VII; and VIII. Now, phantasy remains even when an actualized
          sense is lacking, as it appears in a person who dreams during sleep.
          For in this person there is no particular sense that is actually
          sensing, as it is manifest from the treatise <title>About sleeping and
          being awaken</title>. Even if the common sense in this person is
          actualized, it <supplied>= the common sense</supplied> does not move
          phantasy, but is rather moved by phantasy through the species stored
          in it <supplied>= phantasy</supplied>, as it can be seen in
          <title>About sleeping and being awaken</title>. Therefore etc.

          <supplied><hi rendition="simple:bold">Response:</hi></supplied> In
          order for the question to become evident, some premises are needed.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-07">
          First premise: According to <name>Albert</name>, the sensitive soul’s
          powers are of two kinds. Some of them are able to apprehend from the
          outside, and these are called particular external senses such as
          sight, hearing etc. They are called external, not only because they
          are at the extremities of the body, but <supplied>also</supplied>
          because they are altered by external sensible objects without other
          powers of the souls being first altered: for instance, sight is
          altered by a color without any intermediary sense <supplied>being
          altered</supplied>; and hearing <supplied>is altered</supplied> by a
          sound <supplied>without any intermediary sense being
          altered</supplied>; and so on. And they are called particular because
          each of them is determined <supplied>to cognize</supplied> some
          <supplied>particular</supplied> kind of sensible objects and does not
          cognize any other: for instance, sight <supplied>is determined to
          cognize</supplied> colors and hearing sounds. Some other powers
          <supplied>of the sensitive soul</supplied> are able to apprehend from
          the inside, and these are commonly called internal senses because they
          are altered only by external things by means of other senses. These
          <supplied>inner senses</supplied> are five according to
          <name>Albert</name>, i.e. common sense, imagination, cogitative power,
          phantasy, and memory. About their necessity <supplied>= the necessity
          of assuming these five internal senses</supplied> and about their
          distinction <supplied>= how they differ from each other</supplied>,
          <name>Albert</name> teaches these things.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-08">
          To make this evident I assume two premises. First premise: in
          individual substances, and particularly in human beings, there are not
          only sensible accidents, proper and common, but there are in them also
          some properties which are not cognized by any particular senses. For
          instance, there are in Socrates goodness, malice, paternity,
          being-son, and mildness, anger, health or illness, and ‘when’ and
          ‘where’ and <supplied>further</supplied> forms of this kind which are
          not cognized by any of the senses <supplied>that cognize</supplied>
          particular things. For this reason they are called <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">non-sensed intentions</hi>. This is what
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> suggested clearly enough in his
          booklet <title>About memory and reminiscence</title>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-09">
          Second premise: it does not belong to one and the same power of the
          soul to be good in receiving species and in retaining or storing them.
          The reason for that is according to <name>Albert</name> – who borrows
          the idea from <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name>’ booklet
          <title>About memory and reminiscence</title> – the following: In order
          for a power to be good in receiving, it is required that humidity
          dominates over dryness in the complexion of the power’s organ. For it
          belongs to humid things to be good in receiving impressions, as is
          manifest in the air and water, whereas these
          <supplied>elements</supplied> are not good in retaining. In order to
          be good in retaining, a large domination of dryness is required
          <supplied>in the complexion of the power’s organ</supplied>. For dry
          things surely receive <supplied>impressions</supplied> with difficult,
          but once they have received <supplied>them</supplied>, they are good
          in retaining and storing <supplied>them</supplied>, as is evident in
          stone and wood.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-10">
          After having understood these two premises, I say that we experience
          in ourselves that we cognize the difference between different sensible
          objects. The common sense serves specifically to this
          <supplied>cognition</supplied>. Since this point has already been
          explained <supplied>above, q. 36</supplied>, I move on. Then we
          experience in ourselves that, although sensible objects (both common
          and proper) are absent, we have stored and retain species of them. For
          instance, when the wall is absent you retain along with you a species
          of its color and of its figure and so on; with other sensible objects
          it is similar. And this happens by means of the imaginative power,
          which is also called by some authors a treasure or a coffer of
          sensible forms. And it reasonably needs to happen by means of a power
          that is different from the common sense for the reason previously
          mentioned, namely that it does not belong to the same power to be good
          in retaining and to be good in receiving.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-11">
          Likewise, we experience in ourselves that we cognize non sensed
          properties of individuals. For instance, we cognize this paternity and
          this being-son, this friendship and this hostility and so on. To this
          end, we usually assume a cogitative power. <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> the Commentator teaches many beautiful
          and useful things about this power in different places in his books.
          Now I am going to collect them as correctly and clearly as I can, for
          the sake of goodness.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-12">
          First, <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says in book II of his
          <title>De anima</title> that the cogitative power cognizes individual
          intentions – i.e. <supplied>individual</supplied> forms – of all ten
          categories, for instance the individual form <pb ed="#Ve_1544"
          n="45-v"/><cb ed="#Ve_1544" n="a"/> of this man according to which
          this man is this man, and this line, and this whiteness, and this
          paternity, and warming, and more things of this kind. Thus, the
          cogitative power does not only cognizes the sensible accidents – the
          common and the proper ones –, but also the non-sensed intention, <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">and strips all common and proper sensible
          objects that were joint to the intention, away from it</hi>. With
          “strips away from it” I mean that the cogitative power cognizes the
          intention distinctly and separately. Accordingly, by means of your
          cogitative power you cognize that this soul is not the same as this
          body – this is manifest – and also that this friendship is not the
          same as this color or this magnitude or this motion, and so on. And
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says that the cogitative power
          <hi rendition="simple:italic">places the intention</hi> <supplied>that
          it has grasped</supplied> <hi rendition="simple:italic">in the power
          of memory</hi>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-13">
          Likewise, <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says in book III of
          his <title>De anima</title> about the cogitative power that some
          authors believed it to be the intellect. This belief is especially
          attributed to <name ref="#Galen">Galen</name>. <name
          ref="#Galen">Galen</name>’s reason was that the cogitative power
          belongs properly to the human being, as well as the intellect belongs
          properly to the human being; therefore etc. <supplied>i.e., cogitative
          power and intellect are the same</supplied>. But this is not true
          because the intellect is an immaterial power and does not have any
          underlying body, and it cognizes the quiddity in a universal and
          abstract manner, whereas the cogitative power belongs to the kind of
          powers that exist in a body – this is manifest, since the cogitative
          power has a determined instrument, namely the middle ventricle of the
          brain – and it is an individual and individually distinct power. Nor
          is <name ref="#Galen">Galen</name>’s reason
          <supplied>formally</supplied> valid, since it rests on two affirmative
          premises within the second <supplied>syllogistic</supplied> figure.
          Accordingly, <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> in the same III
          book says that the cogitative power <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">belongs to the kind of the sensitive
          powers</hi>. And he adds that <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">imagination, cogitative power and memory
          only serve</hi> to present <supplied>sensible objects to the
          intellect</supplied> <hi rendition="simple:italic">instead of the
          sensitive power, and for this reason</hi> <supplied>the
          intellect</supplied> <hi rendition="simple:italic">only needs
          them</hi> <supplied>= imagination, cogitative power and
          memory</supplied> <hi rendition="simple:italic">when no sensible
          object is present.</hi> We will see in the III book how this is to be
          understood – if this is God’s will.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-14">
          Again, in the same third book of his <title>De anima</title> <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says about the cogitative power that
          <hi rendition="simple:italic">this power is a kind of reason</hi>. I
          understand this in the following way. As reason is an abstract
          apprehensive power that reasons about things it has apprehended in a
          universal manner, this noble <supplied>= cogitative</supplied> power
          similarly reasons about things apprehended in an individual manner and
          draws inferences from one thing to another in order to cognize an
          unknown thing. From this it follows that the cogitative power properly
          belongs to human beings, since only human beings reason. <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> also says there that one activity of
          the cogitative power <hi rendition="simple:italic">is to put together
          the intention of a form of the imagination with its image within
          memory</hi>. For instance, when somebody remembers to have seen
          something white, the cogitative power in some way puts together
          vision, which is a non-sensed intention, with whiteness, which is a
          sensed form; so that in the act by which somebody judges to have seen
          something white, the imaginative power presents the image of
          whiteness, the power of memory presents the past vision, and the
          cogitative power puts both together. Perhaps this is how <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> thought that the cogitative power puts
          together the intention of a form with an image within memory. Then
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> adds: <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">and</hi> the cogitative power <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">distinguishes</hi> the intention <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">from</hi> the image <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">within formation</hi>, i.e., within
          understanding. For, if the intellect has to understand such an
          intention distinctly, then the cogitative power must first cogitate it
          individually, as it will become evident in the III book. <supplied>q.
          23</supplied>
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-15">
          Further on, <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> in the same III book
          of his <title>De anima</title> says that the cogitative power, when it
          is supported by memory and imagination, will sometimes present an
          individual, i.e., the cogitative power will have a cognition of an
          individual that has not been perceived by the person who is
          cogitating, such as a cognition of a future individual or of a past
          individual. We can for instance understand <supplied>this
          suggestion</supplied> in the following way: When a good physician (a)
          by means of his cogitative power cognizes this illness in this patient
          and its cause and the <supplied>patient’s</supplied> complexion and
          age and place and <supplied>further</supplied> particulars of this
          kind, and (b) by means of his memory he remembers to have seen or
          cognized that such an illness or a similar one was followed by
          <supplied>those patients’</supplied> death, and (c) by means of his
          imaginative power he imagines the <supplied>present</supplied>
          patient’s death, then it happens that (d) the physician judges by a
          true judgement that the person is going to die, as if he presently
          perceived that the person is dying. Likewise, when a good expert of
          natural meteorology (a) cogitates about hail that is going to fall in
          summer, and (b) by means of his memory he remembers to have seen that
          a hailstorm frequently followed such a summerly heatwave and such a
          cloud, and (c) by means of his imagination he imagines a hail fall,
          then (d) by means of his cogitative power he judges by a true and
          correct judgment that hail is going to fall soon, as if he saw hail
          falling actually. One could also make an example from the field of
          possible human actions. But since these things are less certain and
          originate from free choice, I do not want to make any example
          <supplied>from this field</supplied>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-16">
          Thus, this is what <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> adds: <hi

          At this point we have to consider what <name>Albert</name> says about
          the power of phantasy. <name>Albert</name> says – and what he says is
          true – that we experience in ourselves that we combine forms with
          forms and intentions with intentions and intentions with forms or the
          way around. Examples can be made for the sake of those who start to
          make philosophy. (1.) We judge this sweet to be white, and this is to
          combine a form with a form; for under “form”
          <supplied><name>Albert</name></supplied> understands a proper or
          common sensible object. (2.) Likewise we judge this father to be
          friend, and this is to combine an intention with an intention; for
          under “intention” <supplied><name>Albert</name></supplied> understands
          a non-sensible property. (3.) And again we judge this sweet to be
          pleasant or appropriate, and this is to combine an intention with a
          form. And it works in a similar way with other objects of this kind.
          This combination is made by a fourth power, namely the power of
          phantasy, as <supplied><name>Albert</name></supplied> says. And he
          collects further details about this power, but what I have reported is
          enough for the actual purpose.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-20">
          Then we experience in ourselves that, when sensible objects are
          absent, we have their intentions, i.e. their non-sensible properties,
          stored; but it does not belong to one and the same power to be good in
          retaining and to be good in receiving; therefore the retentive power
          needs to be different from the cogitative power that cognizes them
          <supplied>= intentions</supplied> and is good in receiving them. Nor
          is one and the same retentive power that retains both sensible forms
          and non-sensible intentions, for an intention has a higher degree of
          abstraction than a form, as <supplied><name>Albert</name></supplied>
          says. We are therefore compelled to assume a further power, which
          retains the intentions that have been elicited (i.e. distinctively
          cognized) by the cogitative power: this <supplied>further</supplied>
          power is called memory according to a common denomination, but someone
          calls it a treasure of intentions, as imagination is called a treasure
          of forms.

        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-21">
          This is what <name>Albert</name> teaches. And although he speaks
          rightly and truly for the major part, he appears to take distance from
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> to some extent. For <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> only assumes four inner sensitive
          powers, as it is evident in the III book of his <title>De
          anima</title>. There he mentions <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> and says: <hi
          rendition="simple:italic"><name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
          assumed different individual powers at four levels: at the first level
          he assumed the common sense, then imagination, then the cogitative
          power, and finally memory.</hi> And <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> adds: <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">he</hi> <supplied>= <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name></supplied> <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">took memory to be the most spiritual power,
          then the cogitative power, then imagination, and finally the common
          sense.</hi> I guess that the power that <name>Albert</name> calls
          “phantasy” is called by <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name>
          “cogitative power”. And this is reasonable, for it is necessary that
          it is one and the same cognitive power that apprehends both composite
          and simple contents, as <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> himself
          says in the III book of his <title>De anima</title>, in the commentary
          on the chapter that begins with: <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">Intellection of indivisible things …</hi>
          Hence, since the cogitative power cognizes both intentions and forms,
          it is necessary for it to be one and the same power, a capacity of
          combining and distinguishing intentions and forms. Hence it is not
          necessary that any other power combines and distinguishes intentions
          and forms, especially because nature never produces by means of
          multiple instruments what can be produced by means of only one
          instrument. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the cogitative power
          cognizes sensible forms, since a superior cognitive power always
          cognizes what an inferior cognitive power cognizes, but in a more
          perfect way. Therefore I rather believe to <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> <supplied>than to
          <name>Albert</name></supplied>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-22">
          The organs of these powers are commonly assumed to be ten. For
          instance, according to <name>Albert</name> and <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> the common <pb ed="#Ve_1544"
          n="46-r"/><cb ed="#Ve_1544" n="a"/> sense is located in the anterior
          part of the brain’s first cell, in the place where the sensitive
          nerves – i.e. the nerves that originate from the particular senses –
          come together. Then, the imaginative power is located in the posterior
          part of this first cell <supplied>of the brain</supplied> according to
          <name>Albert</name>. In the first part of the middle cell, which is
          warm on account of the animal spirits moving in multiplex ways to it,
          <name>Albert</name> places the cogitative power <supplied>of
          humans</supplied> or the estimative power <supplied>of
          animals</supplied>. In the middle of this same middle cell
          <supplied>of the brain</supplied> <name>Albert</name> places the power
          of phantasy as a sort of center between imagination and memory. For
          memory is located in the posterior part of the brain; this is evident
          because, if this part is injured, then memory is offended. And this is
          likewise evident with regard to the organs of the other sensitive
          powers.

        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-23">
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> actually describes things a bit
          differently, but what he says perhaps amounts to the same. He supposes
          that the common sense is located in the anterior part of the brain’s
          first cell, or perhaps in the heart, because <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> in his treatise <title>On sleeping
          and being awaken</title> seems to defend either both views
          <supplied>about the location of common sense</supplied> or the second
          one. Accordingly, <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says that the
          power of imagination is located in the anterior part of the brain
          (this, according to <name>Albert</name>, is to be understood as a
          reference to the posterior part of the first cell). The cogitative
          power is, according to <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name>, located
          in the middle and the power of memory in the posterior part
          <supplied>of the brain</supplied>. Questions about these powers have
          to be discussed in <supplied>commenting on</supplied> the small
          treatises on natural philosophy <supplied>so called <title>Parva
          naturalia</title></supplied>, especially in <title>On sleeping and
          being awaken</title> and in <title>On memory and reminiscence</title>.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-24">
          We need to take into account that <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> in <title>De anima</title>, book II,
          only mention two of these powers explicitly, namely phantasy and
          common sense. I believe that, under “phantasy”, he sometimes
          understand imagination and sometimes the cogitative power. For he says
          that phantasy stores the species of sensible objects, and this applies
          to the power of imagination; he also says that animals do many things
          on account of this power, and this can only be
          <supplied>understood</supplied> in the sense that animals strive to
          avoid or to pursue what phantasy judges to be either good or bad, and
          this in turn applies without any doubt to the power that is called
          “cogitative” by <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name>. And in
          <title>De anima</title>, book III, <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> says that a certain phantasy is
          rational, namely <supplied>the phantasy</supplied> that reasons about
          individual things; and this belongs to the cogitative power. Hence
          <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> under “phantasy” sometimes
          understands the cogitative power and sometimes the imaginative power,
          <supplied>for instance</supplied> where he says: Since (supply: the
          species of sensible objects, brought about by sensible objects
          according to their being in actuality) are preserved in the
          imaginative power, animals do many things according to this power and
          act and suffer. <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> deals
          separately with memory and reminiscence in his booklet <title>On
          memory and reminiscence</title>. There he declares that reminiscence
          is not different in its substance from the cogitative power.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-25">
          After having seen these things, it must be said about the question
          that phantasy is not the same as a particular external sense, and this
          is what <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> says in the text. He
          delivers many reasons in support of this view, but I will only report
          one of them. If phantasy were an external sense, then phantasy would
          be either a sense in potency or a sense in act, since this alternative
          is exhaustive. Phantasy, however cannot be a sense in potency, because
          it is evident that phantasy would mostly be sight; but persons who
          lack sight do have phantasy, as it appears in blind persons who have
          phantasies in their dreams. Thus it is evident that phantasy is not
          the same as sight. Nevertheless it is mostly evident that phantasy
          took its name from light, which pertains to sight, because sight is
          sense perception in the highest degree, and we retain more phantasms
          of things cognized by sight than by any other sense. Therefore
          phantasy would evidently be in the highest degree sight, rather than
          any other particular sense.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-26">
          Moreover, each and every animal notoriously has a sensitive power, so
          that an animal is an animal on account of sensation. However, some
          animals do not have phantasy: for instance ants and bees, as <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> explains in the text.
          <name>Albert</name> says however that this example is completely
          wrong. For bees build their houses according to some technical skill,
          and ants are provident for themselves with regard to the future – what
          they would not be able to do without imagination or phantasy. Thus
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> seems to assume that bees and
          ants have an imaginative power: bees for the reason of their technical
          skill, and ants for the reason of depositing, i.e., because they
          deposit their nourishment in a determinate place and at a determinate
          time. And <name>Albert</name> believes that this mistake was made not
          by <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, but by the translator
          <supplied>of <title>De anima</title> from Greek into Latin</supplied>:
          the translator did not understand the names of the animals that
          according to <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> lack phantasy,
          and in place of them he put ants and bees. Or if you want to save the
          text and the translator’s honesty, we can read <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>’s example in an affirmative way, so
          that its meaning becomes this: phantasy does not belong to certain
          animals as it belongs to ants and bees. And this is true. A
          determinate phantasy belongs to them <supplied>= ants and
          bees</supplied>, i.e. <supplied>a power</supplied> that can be
          actualized when the sensible objects are absent.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-27">
          <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> in book II of his <title>De
          anima</title>, in the chapter about smell, says about bees that they
          move to their nourishment from very remote places; for, in whichever
          region they may stay, they every single year move to the sea shore at
          some point of time, in order to gain the vigor of their nourishment
          from mud. Ants likewise move from one place to another as if they
          imagined their distant nourishment and they come back to a determinate
          place where they accumulate in summer what they need for living in
          winter. Thus
          <cb ed="#Ve_1544" n="b"/>
          it is written somewher: Wake up, you miserable! Go to an ant and
          consider its way. Although ants do not have a leader, they accumulate
          in summer what they need to live in winter etc.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-28">
          Therefore it is evident that phantasy is not a sense in potency. And
          by the same argument one will be convinced that phantasy is not a
          sense in act <supplied>= a sense actually sensing</supplied>. For a
          sense in act belongs to any animal, whereas phantasy does not belong
          to any one.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-29">
          But we need to consider that according to what <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says in book II of his <title>De
          anima</title>, and <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> suggests in
          book III, phantasy is of two kind. There is first a certain imperfect
          and diminished kind of phantasy which is only actualized when a
          sensible thing is present. All animals, however imperfect, have this
          kind of phantasy; otherwise they would not be able to cognize the
          intention of what is convenient or noxious, and they could not avoid
          what is noxious and pursue what is convenient. We see the opposite in
          the most imperfect animals, i.e. those which only possess the sense of
          touch, as <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> says in book III of
          <title>De anima</title>. For these animals retreat when they are
          punctured or when something inconvenient is applied to them, and they
          could not do this if they did not judge the puncture or the applied
          thing noxious. When something convenient is applied to them, they
          expand themselves onto the applied thing as much as they can; and they
          could not do this either, if they did not cognize that the applied
          thing is convenient. But ‘noxious’ and ‘convenient’ or ‘useful’ are
          non-sensible intentions which no external sense can cognize. As a
          result, the imperfect animals must have an interior cognitive power
          for grasping these <supplied>non-sensible</supplied> properties,
          although they are only able to cognize <supplied>such
          properties</supplied> in a very diminished way and only when a thing
          is present. This is evident from the fact that they never would move
          by themselves form one place to another distant place. Therefore, an
          undetermined phantasy has been attributed to these animals, i.e.an
          imperfect and diminished phantasy. A determined phantasy is, on the
          other hand, a phantasy which grasps contents even when things are
          absent; a phantasy of this kind belongs to animals which can move from
          one place to another.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-30">
          Moreover, that phantasy cannot be a sense according to its being in
          actuality is manifest from another reason: it happens to sleepers –
          although they do not have any actual sensations – that they do have
          imaginary appetites, as it is shown in the treatise
          <title>On sleeping and being awaken</title>. Hence
          phantasy is in no way a particular sense.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="da-28-l2q37-1544en-31">
          It ought to be noticed that phantasy is sometimes taken to be a
          natural power of the sensitive soul and sometimes the actualization of
          this power. And as power, phantasy is sometimes taken to be a power
          that retains sensible species, and then it is the imaginative power;
          sometimes it is taken to be a power for cognizing sensible things
          themselves when they are absent and also for cognizing non-sensible
          intentions, and then it is truly the cogitative power according to
          what <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says in book III of his
          <title>De anima</title>. We see <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> assuming phantasy in the first way
          when he says that species of sensible things which are similar to
          sensible things persist in it <supplied>= phantasy</supplied>. And in
          <title>De anima</title> III <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
          says according to the second way that a certain kind of phantasy is
          rational, as we mentioned previously. And also when he says in
          <title>De anima</title> III that phantasy is a principle of locomotion
          together with the appetitive power, he takes phantasy to be the
          cogitative power. For a power that is a principle of locomotion
          (together with the appetitive power) needs to cognize the thing
          towards which a locomotion has to take place, as a thing that is good
          to be pursued. Accordingly, <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
          shows in book III that the theoretical intellect is not a principle of
          locomotion because it does not say anything about what is to be
          pursued or avoided. And in the chapter of <title>De anima</title> III
          that begins with the words: <hi rendition="simple:italic">But it
          appears that the sensible object …</hi> he writes: <hi
          rendition="simple:italic">Since it affirms or denies or avoids or
          pursues what is pleasant or what is unpleasant.</hi> For the
          appetitive power only desires to pursue what is cognized under the
          concept of good, and it only desires to avoid what is cognized as bad.
          This is also manifest from <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>’s
          book <title>On the locomotion of animals</title> and from book III of
          his <title>Nicomachean Ethics</title>. But the power of phantasy which
          <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> takes to be a principle of
          motion together with the appetitive power cannot be the power that
          only retains images or species, but it has to be a cogitative power in
          the way we have explained previously; and such a power is the
          cogitative power in human beings and the estimative power in animals.
          Thus, it is evident that <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> takes
          phantasy to be the cogitative power <supplied>in humans</supplied> and
          the estimative power <supplied>in animals</supplied>. Further on, when
          he says that <hi rendition="simple:italic">for whoever is
          understanding, it is necessary to consider some phantasm</hi>, I
          believe that under “phantasm” <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name>
          understand the act of the cogitative power. And <supplied>he
          speaks</supplied> likewise in other places while assessing which power
          delivers the intellect <supplied>with phantasms</supplied>. But this
          shall become clearer in <supplied>commenting on</supplied> <title>De
          anima</title> III.

          replying to the first argument I say that it proves phantasy to be a
          sense, assuming sense in a general way as an internal or an external

          external sense.

          replying to the further argument (“powers which have the same object”
          etc.) I say that the argument is true only if the powers that are
          mentioned there, are not ordered to each other in a way that one power
          be altered by another power; but if the powers are ordered in this
          way, then they may somehow have the same object. But phantasy and the
          senses are ordered powers, since phantasy can only be altered by
          external things by the mediation <pb ed="#Ve_1544" n="46-v"/><cb
          ed="#Ve_1544" n="a"/> of a sense. Therefore they can have the same
          object. By contrast, sight and hearing are different powers which are
          not altered by each other. Thus, they do not have the same object, but
          different objects.

          <supplied><hi rendition="simple:bold">To the 3<hi
          rendition="simple:superscript">rd</hi> argument:</hi></supplied> In
          replying to the further argument I say that phantasy is indeed a
          motion brought about by a sense according to its being in act and
          similar to this, as <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> and <name
          ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> say. And as the third argument says
          that “a motion does not persist” etc., one can reply in the following
          way: As in a continuous motion we need to
          <supplied>separately</supplied> consider the perfection received and
          the reception which <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> in
          <title>Physics</title> V calls “transmutation joined with time”,
          likewise in a spiritual and instantaneous alteration we need to
          <supplied>separately</supplied> consider the spiritual quality which
          is being received in a power and the actual transmutation according to
          which <supplied>the power</supplied> is called “transmuted”, or the
          reception according to which <supplied>the power</supplied> is called
          “actually receiving”. If a spiritual motion is taken to be the
          spiritual quality that is received in a subject that is altered by a
          spiritual alteration, then this motion can certainly persist even if
          the motor that has impressed this form is absent or deficient;
          likewise, even if fire that has been warming water becomes absent or
          deficient, the warmth that has been generated by fire can persist in
          the water. And the same happens in many other things. But if motion is
          assumed as the very actual transmutation according to which something
          is said to transmute formally, and this belongs to the category of
          passion according to what <name ref="#Averroes">Averroes</name> says
          in <title>Physics</title> V, then it is true that motion does not
          persist if the motor is lacking; for as soon as fire warming water is
          absent, water does not transmute to warmth any more. And we need to
          understand the definition formulated by <name
          ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> (“phantasy is a motion brought about
          by a sense according to its being in act”) <supplied>in the following
          way: phantasy is</supplied> some spiritual form or quality that has
          been impressed into a power by a sense, after this sense has been
          actualized by a sensible species; and this <supplied>form or
          quality</supplied> persists very well in the retentive power.
          Accordingly, here <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> apparently
          takes phantasy to be the act that the imaginative power receives from
          an actualized sense. Therefore, the argument is not valid. Some
          interpreters said that the definition is to be understood in this way:
          “phantasy is a motion” etc. means “<supplied>phantasy is</supplied> a
          power naturally apt to being moved by a sense according to its being
          in act.” In this way, <name ref="#Aristotle">Aristotle</name> would
          here assume an accident as the subject in order to notify it.
          Therefore the argument is not valid.
